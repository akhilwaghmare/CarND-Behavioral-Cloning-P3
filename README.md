In this project, we use deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks to clone driving behavior. We train, validate and test a model using Keras. The model outputs a steering angle to an autonomous vehicle.

The autonomous vehicle runs in a simulator where you can steer a car around a track for data collection. We use image data and steering angles to train a neural network and then use this model to drive the car autonomously around the track.
